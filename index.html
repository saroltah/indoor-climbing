        <p>
          As an exercise, you really canâ€™t do better than climbing. Indoor
          climbing will improve all aspects of your physical condition. You will
          see improvement in your balance, flexibility, and agility and develop
          both upper and lower body strength. Best of all, you will burn
          calories at a higher rate than most strenuous workouts and will do it
          before you know it.
          <br />
          Climbing gyms give you an enjoyable venue for social interaction with
          like-minded people. It's a place for trust building, camaraderie, and
          self confidence.
          <br />
          This is a fun sport for everyone, from novice, sport, competitive, to
          professional climbers it's an amazing activity or even lifestyle.
